# Relational-Database-for-Device
Data Structure created using Microsoft Access to collect data from mobile device 


this was originally created as a challenge for my first data science internship. The prompt was to design a database for something I interact with frequently. It's actually really bad due to the fact that it was entiely overambitious for my level of mastery with Access, however, I still think its an interesting project and thinkpiece. Going forward I would have a much more humble approach and would probably have made this project centered around university, classes, and related data; something with a much clearer hierarchical distinction for ease of translation. The kind of data I'm mapping in this database is probably better off in a non-relational database entirely. But its fun, nostalgic, and a little dicey. So its staying, in case anyone wants to build on this any further.

If you have any q's, message me through slack, email, or ig @vrtlbot
